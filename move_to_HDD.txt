Here is how I did it.

Boot from my SD card (Debian), with USB Drive connected.

Start up X windows as root (sudo startx)

Run gparted, and create partition on USB drive (use ext4 format, I will 
assume it is called /dev/sda1)
(you may need to install gparted (apt-get install gparted)

mount the USB drive partition 
sudo mkdir /mnt/newroot
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/newroot

Copy contents of / (root partition to USB /dev/sda1)
(You may need to install rsync, (apt-get install rsync)
sudo rsync -avxS / /mnt/newroot

Change /boot/cmdline.txt
root=/dev/sda1

Reboot RPi.
Confirm you're rootfs is now on /dev/sda1 (The size of the partition 
will be a big give away here.)

You can now delete the old partition on the SD Card if you want to. I 
have kept mine as an emergency rootfs if I need it.


I think that is all, this is from memory as I am not near my RPi at the 
moment, but I have done this about 6 times now on two different RPi's, 
and I have not had a problem yet.  :)
